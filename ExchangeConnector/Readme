Exchange Connector
Exchange Connector has below modules
1) Event Loop
    This encapsulates the event processing thread, as multiple connections are expected epoll is used.
    it runs a thread and waits on epoll.
    Sessions are added to this Event loop for handling events on these sessions.
2) Exchange Session:
    Each session represents a socket connection made to exchange. As partial or multiple packets can be received 
    a buffer is used to store session specific partial data.
3) Sorted List:
    Sorted list is basically a sorted array, where elements are always sorted. Choice of this data structure is made 
    because all exchanges are sending sorted data so once exchange A sends integer next integer will be inserted at higher index. 
    wont be immediate next because other exchanges are also sending data. With above assumption each session will store the last 
    inserted index and search is done after that index only. Which will make it faster and less movements of data will be done.
    This logic can be easily removed by changing one line code. Heap data structure is also suitable for this.

4) As problem statement mentions only port number to be provided on command line assuming servers will run on localhost.
5) Assuming same byte order on hosts.
